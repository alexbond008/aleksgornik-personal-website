        Hi, I‚Äôm <span class="font-bold">Aleks</span>, an engineer passionate about <span class="font-bold">Machine Learning</span> and building amazing <span class="font-bold">products</span>. I‚Äôm delusionally optimistic and full of energy. I love building products that make a difference and I'm not afraid to take risks. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and thrive where I can make a big impact.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I love writing code for products that help solve real problems. I also enjoy speaking to clients and customers, as well as being on stage showcasing technology. I don‚Äôt fear the live demo; as a matter of fact, I love it. I enjoy the spotlight and have had the privilege to demo products and technology to large audiences many times now.

         managed to deploy an AI-powered lead generation feature to an existing app called Sidekick. SumUp has field sales reps all around the UK trying to sell SumUp hardware, which is a very difficult job, especially if you‚Äôre just starting out. We built this product to help them target the right businesses using Machine Learning. Based on existing data at SumUp, we built an ML model that learned how to identify ‚Äògood‚Äô leads. We looked at everything: business age, location, price levels, estimated monthly turnover, multi-location status, and much more.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2">
        Since we scraped so much data on businesses, we also decided to summarise the information into key details using the GPT API. The result was a really cool feature that would display the best businesses for sales in a UK postcode, along with AI-summarised business insights.

        This is a funny story because I was interviewed and joined as a hardware test engineering intern. However, I soon realised that there wasn‚Äôt much hardware work happening. I was quickly put on a

        client project to automate some tests. This was a legacy codebase, and since I'd never written a line of code professionally before, I lost my head a bit when I got my first ticket. Once I remembered how to use Git and figured out how to move around a Linux machine, I started to get going. Three months later, the project had a full CI/CD pipeline with over 25 automated tests up and running. Well done to me.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2">
        Another big highlight was working on a really cool internal R&D project titled 'Detecting Nanoparticle Motion in Tissue via Magnetic Spectroscopy'. It was great. I was writing signal processing code in Python, working in a wet lab to ensure my colleague used the correct biomarker concentrations, and building a simple op-amp in the electronics lab. I was back and forth with a physicist, figuring out how to build a safe coil that could output 10mT. I made a video for our live demo and even got to pitch the technology in front of the whole company. We somehow won the competition, even though the demo didn‚Äôt work on the day. I guess the tech was just that cool. If you're curious about the technical details, I wrote a paper on this, and it‚Äôs in my projects section.

        Before I started university, I was incredibly lucky to get some work experience at a tech company in London. I had the full "tech bro" experience at 17: a MacBook Pro, a fancy building in Central London, daily stand-ups, free breakfast every day, table tennis, and pool. But seriously, I was introduced to very important concepts that I use every day, like GitHub, branching techniques, agile methodology, and writing Python code in a professional setting where people actually need to review your code. In my opinion, those were the most important three weeks of my professional life.
